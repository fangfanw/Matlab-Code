 
The MATLAB code "SampleCode.m" analyzes the data "SimulatedData.mat" using the methodology described in the paper "Modeling Non-stationary Multivariate Time Series of Counts via Common Factors‚Äù by Wang and Wang (2018). The covariates are the ones that appear in Eq. (20) of the paper. Their coefficients are estimated using the MATLAB code "PoisPara_fminunc.m" and "ObjLn.m".
